🚨 The Problem
With rising concerns over women’s safety in urban environments, traditional surveillance just isn't enough.
What if technology could recognize a threat before it becomes one?
This is where Women Safety Analytics steps in — providing proactive threat detection powered by computer vision and real-time analytics.

💡 Our Vision
To build an intelligent safety monitoring solution that:!

Protects women by detecting risks in real time

Supports law enforcement with data-driven insights

Builds safer communities using predictive analysis and pattern recognition

🎯 Key Features
Feature	Description
👥 Person & Gender Detection	Detects people in the frame and classifies gender in real time
📊 Gender Distribution Analysis	Analyzes male-female ratios at specific locations and times
🌃 Lone Woman Detection at Night	Flags when a woman is detected alone during nighttime
🧍‍♀️🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️ Surrounded by Men Alert	Recognizes when a woman is encircled by multiple men
✋ SOS Gesture Recognition	Detects emergency hand gestures or movements
📍 Hotspot Identification	Maps areas where safety alerts are frequently triggered

⚙️ How It Works
Step 1: Real-time video feed input
Step 2: Object & gender detection using AI/ML models (e.g., YOLOv5 + gender classifier)
Step 3: Scene analysis for anomaly detection
Step 4: Alert generation to notify authorities or trigger safety protocols

🌐 Real-Life Use Cases
Public Transport Terminals (stations, subways)

Campus Security in colleges or universities

Street Surveillance in city hotspots

Smart Cities integrating with municipal control centers

🧠 Tech Stack
Python | OpenCV | YOLOv5

Deep Learning Models (CNN-based gender classifier)
